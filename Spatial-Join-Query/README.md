# Spatial-Join-Query
Modified original GeoSpark source code(https://github.com/DataSystemsLab/GeoSpark) to do a Spatial Join Query using the simple Cartesian Product algorithm.

The file modified: src/main/java/org/datasyslab/geospark/spatialOperator/JoinQuery.java

A piece of pseudo code is available here: https://gist.github.com/jiayuasu/28cb8edb3287f705ed4d30c30de07639
